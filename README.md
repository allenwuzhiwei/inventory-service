# ðŸ“¦ Inventory MicroService - E-commerce Backend Module

## Overview

The **Inventory Service** is a core microservice within our e-commerce platform.  
It is responsible for managing product inventory data, including real-time stock tracking, deduction during order placement, restoration on order cancellation, and inventory logging.

It is built using **Spring Boot**, **MyBatis-Plus**, and supports RESTful API interaction with other microservices like Order Service and Product Service.

## Project Structure

The `inventory-service` project follows a modular **Spring Boot + MyBatis Plus** architecture,  
with a layered structure for configuration, controller, service, mapper, and entity responsibilities.

- `config/`  
  âž¤ Contains API response model, global exception handling, Swagger integration, and security configuration.

- `controller/`  
  âž¤ Exposes RESTful APIs for inventory operations such as retrieval, deduction, restoration, and log viewing.

- `dto/`  
  âž¤ Contains request body definitions for stock deduction and rollback (e.g. `InventoryChangeRequest`, `InventoryRestoreRequest`).

- `entity/`  
  âž¤ Domain model classes:  
  `Inventory` - represents stock quantity for a product  
  `InventoryLog` - records each inventory operation

- `mapper/`  
  âž¤ MyBatis Plus mappers for performing CRUD operations on inventory and logs.

- `service/` and `service/impl/`  
  âž¤ Business logic for managing stock and audit logs.

- `resources/`  
  âž¤ Contains `application.properties` and other Spring Boot resource files.

- `InventoryApplication.java`  
  âž¤ Main entry point of the inventory microservice.

- `pom.xml`  
  âž¤ Maven project configuration for dependencies and build management.
